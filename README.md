# Sijia Han's Portfolio Website ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal portfolio website page! The portfolio page is inspired by [Yuji Sato](https://yujisatojr.github.io/react-portfolio-template/).

## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm install
```

Install dependencies.

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```
npm run deploy
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
